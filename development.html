<center><h2>My Strengths</h2></center>
<br>
<p>
<b>Trustworthy</b> - Being trustworthy means that i am reliable, dependable, and worthy of trust. People who are trustworthy will do what they say they will do.
	I try not to break any promises I make and not let people down. For me its is important to be trustworthy. It shows you have integrity and strong moral 
	values.  being trustworthy mean I  have a better relationship with people if they know they can trust me. Trustworthy people make good friends, business,
	associates, partners, etc. It is VERY difficult to tell the truth. It could feel uncomfortable or embarrassing. When your sincerity is called into doubt, 
	emotions can get intense. But in a setting where being honest is safe, strong character grows. Being honest with others is one method to show others that 
	you care about them. And one way to demonstrate your leadership is to always tell the truth, whatever how challenging it may be. 
	<br><br>
<b>Open-Mindedness</b> - One of the qualities of Wisdom is open-mindedness, which is connected to other qualities like curiosity and perspective.
	These skills include knowledge acquisition and application for personal and societal improvement. I am a very open-minded person, I always and willing to
	try new things and have new experiences. This has help me with my creative side and my critical thinking skills, I am able engage in more productive 
	conversations and have a different view points on different topics.Being open-minded is difficult, and it takes focus to avoid experiencing cognitive 
	dissonance while discovering new ideas that run against to one's preconceived notions. An essential component of education and personal development 
	is the capacity to alter out-of-date or false beliefs. 
	<br><br>
	<b>Dedicated</b> - I am a very dedicated individual, rather than seeing changes as a challenge, I see it as an exciting opportunity to learn something new.
	I also am always eager to help persons/team members embrace such changes. Each successful person's level of dedication, which expresses their commitment 
	to reaching goals in life, is a key component in their success. If you ever experience a loss of inspiration or motivation in your work to the point where 
	you consider halting or even quitting, it may be due to a lack of dedication on your part. No matter what you are doing—working at a job, going to school, 
	or running a business people will always tell you that dedication is a key component of success. They will tell you that in order to eventually reap the 
	benefits of your accomplishment, you must be committed. If you are dedicated and committed to anything, you will remain with it through good times and bad 
	and get through any challenges that may emerge. Disadvantages will be surmounted until the objective is attained, which will finally lead to success, with 
	dedication and perseverance.

<center><h2>Summary of "Tweleve Pillars" by	Jim	Rohn and Chris Widener (Chapter 4-7)</h2></center>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>Chapter 4</b> - Achieve Your Goals is the fourth pillar. I've read and heard this advice to write down your goals numerous times. They become real when they
	are written. In addition to helping you achieve your goals, it also improves you as a person. The main benefit of creating goals is how motivated they make
	you to achieve them. Plans will alter, but your goals will remain the same, as I just learnt from someone else. "Plan, Do, Check, Adjust" is a useful 
	method for monitoring your progress. In the book, Michael and Charlie discuss the importance of writing down goals. Michael admits feeling frustrated over 
	the years because he desperately wanted to be successful, but hadn’t known where to start..Charlie merely advised Michael to write down his aspirations. 
	Setting goals in writing helps them become real instead of just ideas in your head. A good quote from the book is 
	“The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.”
	<br><br>
	<b>Chapter 5</b> - Fifth Pillar: "The Proper Use of Time" The pain of discipline weighs only a few ounces, however the pain of regret weighs several tons. 
	Don't put off taking action since the end of your life will arrive sooner than you think. Spend each day wisely because there is only one best opportunity 
	each day, therefore keep in mind that every day you spend is one less day you have to spend. The best chances are ones that fit in with your long-term 
	objectives. Understand the distinction between important and urgent matters.Days are costly and priceless! A day wasted means one less day available for 
	other activities. Make sure you wisely invest each one. The majority of individuals focus on the urgent above the important when using their time. 
	People fall into the time management trap all the time. If you let it, the urgent is a master who will make you his slave. Being in control of time is 
	preferable to being the other way around. Being the architect of our lives is crucial! If you don't create your own life plan, you probably will end 
	yourself in someone else's. And do you know what they have in store for you? Not much. There will be a master and a slave. If you let the day run you, 
	it will. Control your time or it controls you.
	<br><br>
	<b>Chapter 6</b> - The sixth pillar of Success: When Michael and Charlie meet this time, Michael tells that his relationship with Amy is doing great! His 
		100 life objectives are on paper. Michael is questioned by Charlie about his influences, particularly the people he hangs out with. Michael describes 
		to Charlie each of his close buddies and how they interact. It turned out that he was surrounded by pals who didn't do much to motivate him to improve 
		and accomplish his objectives. Charlie suggests that he begin reading and explains why it is so crucial. Charlie puts Michael to the test by demanding 
		that he finish a book before asking him for any more success tips. "Avoid easy crowds if you want to advance. Go where there are rigorous standards and
		performance requirements." People have a remarkable ability to shape your future. Whether it's a good, bad, or neutral association, every relationship 
		you have is one. Consider the following queries regarding your relationships. Is anyone around me? Why are they having such an impact on me? What are 
		they making me read? What are they making me say? Where are they taking me? What are they making me think? What do they envision myself as? Then assess
		your competency with the responses.
		<br><br>
		<b>Chapter 7</b> - Seventh Pillar of Success: Be a Lifelong Learner. What you learn on your own is known as self-education. It is what you discover 
		along the journey that will keep you evolving and expanding. Being focused on continual learning can help you stand out from the crowd because most 
		individuals don't do it. Wealth begins with education. Health begins with education. Spirituality begins with learning. The magical process all starts 
		with searching and learning. The majority of life is experienced after formal education. Therefore, the remaining steps are up to you. The books must 
		be read by you. The best learning resources available to people today have been and will be books.
		Read books - Throughout history, books have served as, and will continue to serve as, one of the most effective resources for learning. Not the price 
		of the book. If you don't read it, it will cost you something. Have you ever wished you could have dinner with some of history's greatest figures of 
		thought or leadership? When you read their books, you can. If you don't continuously and deliberately seek out information and concepts that will 
		advance your life, how will you ever develop and grow? Observe successful people and pick their brains.
